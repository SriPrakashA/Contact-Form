## What is the use of this Project

This Project is a Simple ReactJS Project which demonstrates the following
1. Intially We list all existing contacts
2. We can add new contact by routing addcontact module
3. Also we can edit or delete the existing contacts.
4. We are storing all the existing contacts in localstorage.

In this project I have used react features like react-router-dom for routing purpose. Used hooks like useContext for state management, useReducer to update the state , useState and useEffect. Added suspense and lazy for performance optimization. Atlast I have developed each component in optimized and efficient manner.
